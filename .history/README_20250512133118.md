3. Add your 3D model:
   - Place your GLB/GLTF model file in `/public/models/` as `product.glb`

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Customization

### Using Your Own 3D Model

Place your GLB file in `/public/models/` directory and update the model path in `components/CanvasScene.tsx` if necessary.

### Changing Default Material Properties

Edit the initial state in `stores/useConfiguratorStore.ts` to change default color, metalness, or roughness.

### Adding Accessories

2. They will automatically be handled by the toggle functionality

## Extending
